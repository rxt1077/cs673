# StockServer

This is a multithreaded server for fetching stock prices from Yahoo Finance

## Requirements

**v1.0 3a**: Stock prices should be fetched by a Java component which will listen on a
specific TCPIP port and fetch the price of the stock from Yahoo or Google.  (We
will test this component separately.) This component will accept text input of
the form ‘TICKER,DATE’ and it will respond with the price as ‘USD,200.92’ or
‘INR,1822.92’ Your system must use this component to fetch all stock prices. Later
in the term you will be supplied with another team/s component which will do the
same thing.

## Errors
